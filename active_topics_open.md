## Open
 - **Generation review**: Review generation limits (per minute/hour/day by clinic) - not a priority for now - can be discussed after M11.
 - **Force regen logging**: Validate we can track by clinic and how to use logging. Is that enough without tracking in Firestore?
 - **Subsequent case edit**: Currently a case only includes successful images and there is nothing further which can be done. Explore wheter it should include regeneration of failures, addition of new variants (new colours/materials), etc. - This is likely to become (one or more) extended ACs to be part of MVP (Milestone TBD)
